# Created by use_targets().
# Follow the comments below to fill in this target script.
# Then follow the manual to check and run the pipeline:
#   https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html#inspect-the-pipeline # nolint

# Load packages required to define the pipeline:
library(targets)
# library(tarchetypes) # Load other packages as needed. # nolint

# Set target options:
tar_option_set(
  packages = c("tibble"), # packages that your targets need to run
  format = "rds" # default storage format
  # Set other options as needed.
)

# tar_make_clustermq() configuration (okay to leave alone):
options(clustermq.scheduler = "multiprocess")

# tar_make_future() configuration (okay to leave alone):
# Install packages {{future}}, {{future.callr}}, and {{future.batchtools}} to allow use_targets() to configure tar_make_future() options.

# Load the R scripts with your custom functions:
lapply(list.files("R", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE), source)
# source("other_functions.R") # Source other scripts as needed. # nolint

# Replace the target list below with your own:
list(

  # Track Key files ---------------------------------------------------------
  # anything that might change

    command = tibble(x = rnorm(100), y = rnorm(100))
